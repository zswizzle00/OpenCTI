# Suspicious Network Activity Investigation Playbook

## Overview
This playbook provides guidance for investigating suspicious network connections and potential data exfiltration attempts detected by the YARA-L rule.

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Initial Triage
- Review the alert details in Google SecOps SIEM
- Check the source and destination IP addresses
- Verify the connection ports and protocols
- Examine the data transfer volume

### 2. Network Analysis
- Analyze the network connection patterns
- Check for unusual data transfer volumes
- Look for connections to known malicious IPs
- Examine DNS queries associated with the connection

### 3. Endpoint Analysis
- Identify the source endpoint
- Check for suspicious processes
- Examine running services
- Look for persistence mechanisms

### 4. Data Analysis
- Determine what data was transferred
- Check file access patterns
- Look for encryption or compression
- Analyze transfer timing and patterns

### 5. User Context
- Identify the user account
- Check for privilege escalation
- Review user's recent activities
- Look for suspicious login patterns

### 6. Response Actions
- Document findings
- Isolate affected systems
- Block malicious IPs
- Update firewall rules
- Collect forensic evidence

## Recommended Tools
- Google SecOps SIEM
